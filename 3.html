<p style="margin-top: 45px;">
    Coming out of my cage
    And I've been doing just fine
    Gotta gotta be down
    Because I want it all
    It started out with a kiss
    How did it end up like this?
    It was only a kiss, it was only a kiss
    Now I'm falling asleep
    And she's calling a cab
    While he's having a smoke
    And she's taking a drag
    Now they're going to bed
    And my stomach is sick
    And it's all in my head
    But she's touching his chest now
    He takes off her dress now
    Let me go
    And I just can't look, it's killing me
    And taking control
    Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
    Swimming through sick lullabies
    Choking on your alibis
    But it's just the price I pay
    Destiny is calling me
    Open up my eager eyes
    'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
    I'm coming out of my cage
    And I've been doing just fine
    Gotta gotta be down
    Because I want it all
    It started out with a kiss
    How did it end up like this?
    (It was only a kiss), it was only a kiss
    Now I'm falling asleep
    And she's calling a cab
    While he's having a smoke
    And she's taking a drag
    Now they're going to bed

    And it's all in my head

    Choking on your alibi
    But it's just the price I pay
    Destiny is calling me
    Open up my eager eyes
    'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside
    I never
    I never
    I never
    I never
